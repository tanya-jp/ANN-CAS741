\section{Reference Material}

This section records information for easy reference.

\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system. 
In this document, we do not use any specific SI unit.
While the SI unit system is primarily employed, for image dimensions, the unit 
of pixels (px) is used due to its relevance and standard usage in image processing tasks.
Derived units are used as described below. For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.

~\newline

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}

  \noindent \begin{tabular}{l l l} 
    \toprule		
    \textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{SI}\\
    \midrule 
    px & pixel (matrix entity) & 	Non-SI (custom)\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  	% \caption{Provide a caption}
\end{table}

% \plt{Only include the units that your SRS actually uses.}

% \plt{Derived units, like newtons, pascal, etc, should show their derivation
%     (the units they are derived from) if their constituent units are in the
%     table of units (that is, if the units they are derived from are used in the
%     document).  For instance, the derivation of pascals as
%     $\si{\pascal}=\si{\newton\per\square\meter}$ is shown if newtons and m are
%     both in the table.  The derivations of newtons would not be shown if kg and
%     s are not both in the table.}

% \plt{The symbol for units named after people use capital letters, but the name
%   of the unit itself uses lower case.  For instance, pascals use the symbol Pa,
%   watts use the symbol W, teslas use the symbol T, newtons use the symbol N,
%   etc.  The one exception to this is degree Celsius.  Details on writing metric
%   units can be found on the 
%   \href{https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units}
%   {NIST} web-page.}

\subsection{Table of Symbols}

The table that follows summarizes the symbols used in this document along with
their units.  The choice of symbols was made to be consistent with Artificail 
Neural Network literature and with existing documentation for Image 
Classification.  The symbols are listed in alphabetical order.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}

\subsection{Mathematical Notation}

% \plt{This section is optional, but should be included for projects that make use
%   of notation to convey mathematical information.  For instance, if typographic
%   conventions (like bold face font) are used to distinguish matrices, this
%   should be stated here.  If symbols are used to show mathematical operations,
%   these should be summarized here.  In some cases the easiest way to summarize
%   the notation is to point to a text or other source that explains the
%   notation.}

% \plt{This section was added to the template because some students use very
%   domain specific notation.  This notation will not be readily understandable to
%   people outside of your domain.  It should be explained.}
\begin{inparaitem}
\textbf{Typographic Conventions:} In this document, matrices are denoted by bold uppercase letters 
(e.g., W for weight matrices), vectors by bold lowercase letters (e.g., a for activation vectors), 
and scalars by regular font (e.g., $\alpha$ for the learning rate). Greek letters are used for specific 
functions or parameters (e.g., $\sigma$ for the activation function).
\\ 
\textbf{Symbols for Mathematical Operations:}

\begin{inparaitem}
\item $\nabla$ (nabla): Represents the gradient operator, used in gradient descent.

\item $\Sigma$ (sigma): Denotes summation.

\item $\partial$ : Symbol for partial derivatives, indicating the rate of change of a function with respect to one 
of its variables while keeping other variables constant. It is extensively used in backpropagation 
algorithms for calculating gradients.

\section{Introduction}

% \plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts
%   general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with
% a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap''
% paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to
% expect in the Introduction section.}
The evolution of machine learning and its profound impact on various fields has led to remarkable advancements, 
particularly in the area of image classification. This project delves into the exploration of enhancing an 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to tackle the challenge of classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR10}. 
This dataset, known for its diverse range of images, serves as a crucial benchmark in assessing the 
capabilities of image recognition algorithms. Our goal is to not only improve the accuracy of the ANN but 
also to make it robust enough to handle all ten categories of the dataset effectively.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

% \plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
%   on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
%   Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
%   in the context of the project itself, not in the context of this course.
%   Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade, you should not
%   mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real project.  The purpose
%   section will be similar between projects.  The purpose of the document is the
%   purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning for the design stage,
%   etc.}
The primary purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to clearly define the software 
requirements for the development of an advanced neural network model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 
dataset. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system, addressing various aspects 
such as the project's goals, theoretical underpinnings, and fundamental definitions. It maintains an abstract 
perspective, focusing on identifying and specifying what needs to be solved rather than delving into the technicalities 
of how these solutions will be implemented. The document will describe the system context and constraints, delineate 
the specific problem definition, and outline the requirements and characteristics of the proposed solution. Additionally, 
it will address potential changes and modifications that could impact the development of the neural network model.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

% \plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
%   the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
%   for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
%   the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
%   the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
%   actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
%   it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
%   properties, etc.}  
The scope of this project is specifically tailored to developing an enhanced neural network model for image 
classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR10}. This involves:

\begin{inparaitem}

\item \textbf{Model Complexity:} The project will concentrate on enhancing an existing ANN architecture. 
 It will not venture into developing entirely new models from scratch or exploring unrelated AI domains 
 like natural language processing.

\item \textbf{Operational Boundaries:} The tool will be designed for a general-purpose computing environment, 
 without tailoring for specialized hardware like high-performance GPU clusters.

\item \textbf{Functional Focus:} The primary function is to improve classification accuracy and efficiency. 
Features outside the realm of image classification, such as real-time data processing or integration with external 
APIs, are outside the project's scope.

\end{inparaitem}

For more details, you can also see the assumptions section (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).
% \plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
%   (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
%   at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
%   on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
%   describes, all of the assumptions.}

% \plt{The scope section is relevant for later determining typical values of inputs. The scope should make it clear what 
% inputs are reasonable to expect. This is a distinction between scope and context (context is a later section).  
% Scope affects the inputs while context affects how the software will be used.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

% \plt{This section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
%   SRS.  It does NOT have the same purpose as the ``User Characteristics''
%   section (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}).  The intended readers are the
%   people that will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that
%   will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the
%   requirements.  The user, on the other hand, is the person that uses the
%   software that is built.  They may never read this SRS document.  Of course,
%   the same person could be a ``user'' and an ``intended reader.''}

% \plt{The intended reader characteristics should be written as unambiguously and
%   as specifically as possible.  Rather than say, the user should have an
%   understanding of physics, say what kind of physics and at what level.  For
%   instance, is high school physics adequate, or should the reader have had a
%   graduate course on advanced quantum mechanics?}
The intended readers for this project, which involves developing an enhanced neural network model for image 
classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR}, are likely to be individuals with a solid background in computer science, 
specifically in the areas of machine learning and neural networks. However, as explained in Section: 
User Characteristics (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}), users of this project  are a broad audience 
interested in image classification, without the necessity for a deep technical background in machine learning or 
neural networks.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

% \plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
%   reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
%   select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
%   be similar between project.}
The organization of this document is modeled on the SRS template for scientific computing software as outlined 
by \citet{SmithandLai2005}. This approach systematically presents the system's objectives, theoretical underpinnings, 
definitions, and foundational assumptions. To facilitate a top-down reading approach, the readers 
can begin by reading the system's goal statements (Section~\ref{GoalStatements}). 
Following this, the theoretical models are detailed, which build upon and clarify the goals. 
The document concludes with instance models, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of the 
system's practical applications and functionalities.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  
% \plt{This text can likely be
%   borrowed verbatim.}

% \plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
%   system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
%   understand. The general system description section is designed to be
%   changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
%   the specific system description. The general system description provides a
%   context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
%   same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

% \plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
%   the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
%   abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
%   $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
%   pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
%   provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
%   inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
%   properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
%   an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
%   entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
%   library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
%   If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
%   libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
%   They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
%   the system constraint.}
The system's context, as depicted in Figure~\ref{Fig_SystemContext}, comprises three main elements: 
circles, a rectangle, and arrows. The circles symbolize the user who interacts with the software. 
The rectangle signifies the truss tool software system itself. 
Arrows in the diagram are used to illustrate the flow of data, showing both the input provided by 
the user and the output data generated by the system that is relevant and useful to the user. 
This setup provides a clear visual framework of the system's interaction dynamics.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{System Context.PNG}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

% \plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
%   should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
%   but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
%   of responsibilities should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
%   should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
%   information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
%   ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
%   For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
%   stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Input correct and relevant data into the system
\item Upload images that are compatible with the system's specifications 
and within the scope of the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR} classifications
\end{itemize}
\item ANN Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as text file instead of an image
\item Process image data, ensuring timely and accurate output
\item Allows users to easily upload images and view classification results
\item Ensure the security and privacy of any data uploaded by users for classification
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% \plt{Identify in what context the software will typically be used.  Is it for
% exploration? education? engineering work? scientific work?. Identify whether it
% will be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications.} \plt{This
% additional context information is needed to determine how much effort should be
% devoted to the rationale section.  If the application is safety-critical, the
% bar is higher.  This is currently less structured, but analogous to, the idea to
% the Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) that McSCert uses in their
% automotive hazard analyses.}

% \wss{The }
\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

% \plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
%   Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
%   requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
%   different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
%   Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
%   user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
%   end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
%   Calculus and Physics.''}
The users of this image classification system are anticipated to have basic proficiency 
in using software for tasks such as uploading images. Their understanding of image 
classification should be fundamental, enough to set realistic expectations of the system's 
functionality. Extensive expertise in machine learning is not required, but a general familiarity 
with the types of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR} will be beneficial for choosing appropriate 
images for classification. Additionally, a keen interest or curiosity in the practical applications 
of machine learning, especially in areas like image classification, will likely enhance their experience 
and engagement with the system.

\subsection{System Constraints}

% \plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
%   limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
%   eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
%   where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
%   abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
%   included if they are truly required.}
In this project, system constraints are critical as they shape the design space and specify how 
the system must integrate into the real world.

\begin{inparaitem}
  \textbf{Technical Resource Limitations:} The system's design is bound by the available computational 
  resources, such as processing power and memory capacity, which influence the complexity and 
  efficiency of the neural network model.

  \textbf{Dataset Constraints:} The system is tailored specifically for the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR}. 
  This specialization may limit its effectiveness with other types of image data.
  Moreover, this system cannot classify any images that is not in the 10 classes.
\end{inparaitem}

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
% the instance models.  \plt{Add any project specific details that are relevant
%   for the section overview.}

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

% \progname{ANN} is intended to solve ... \plt{What problem does your program solve?
% The description here should be in the problem space, not the solution space.}
The ANN in this project is intended to solve the complex challenge of image classification, 
a task that involves correctly identifying the content of digital images. The problem arises 
from the need for a highly accurate, efficient, and reliable classification model that can 
navigate through the intricacies of image data, discerning subtle differences and patterns.  

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

% \plt{This section is expressed in words, not with equations.  It provide the
%   meaning of the different words and phrases used in the domain of the problem.
% The terminology is used to introduce concepts from the world outside of the
% mathematical model  The terminology provides a real world connection to give the
% mathematical model meaning.}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Artificial Neural Network (ANN):} A computational model inspired by the human brain's 
network of neurons, used for tasks like image recognition and classification.

\item \textbf{Image Classification:} The process of identifying and categorizing elements in a 
digital image into predefined classes.

\item \textbf{CIFAR-10 Dataset \cite{CIFAR}:} A collection of images used for evaluating machine learning 
models, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

\item \textbf{Accuracy:} In the context of an ANN, the degree to which the model correctly 
classifies test images.

\item \textbf{Efficiency:} Refers to the computational performance of the ANN, including 
processing speed and resource utilization.

\item \textbf{Reliability:} The consistency of the ANN's performance across various datasets 
and under different conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

% \plt{The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the
%   physical system that is to be modelled. Effective problem solving requires a
%   logical and organized approach. The statements on the physical system to be
%   studied should cover enough information to solve the problem. The physical
%   description involves element identification, where elements are defined as
%   independent and separable items of the physical system. Some example elements
%   include acceleration due to gravity, the mass of an object, and the size and
%   shape of an object. Each element should be identified and labelled, with their
%   interesting properties specified clearly. The physical description can also
%   include interactions of the elements, such as the following: i) the
%   interactions between the elements and their physical environment; ii) the
%   interactions between elements; and, iii) the initial or boundary conditions.}

This ANN system is primarily software-based, focusing on computational processes and 
algorithms for image classification, and consequently, does not have a physical description in the 
traditional sense. Therefore, its description revolves around software architecture, data 
processing methods, user interface design, and performance metrics, rather than physical characteristics.

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}\label{GoalStatements}

% \plt{The goal statements refine the ``Problem Description''
%   (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  A goal is a functional objective the system under
%   consideration should achieve. Goals provide criteria for sufficient
%   completeness of a requirements specification and for requirements
%   pertinence. Goals will be refined in Section “Instanced Models”
%   (Section~\ref{sec_instance}). Large and complex goals should be decomposed
%   into smaller sub-goals.  The goals are written abstractly, with a minimal
%   amount of technical language.  They should be understandable by non-domain
%   experts.}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

% \plt{This section specifies the information in the solution domain of the system
%   to be developed. This section is intended to express what is required in
%   such a way that analysts and stakeholders get a clear picture, and the
%   latter will accept it. The purpose of this section is to reduce the problem
%   into one expressed in mathematical terms. Mathematical expertise is used to
%   extract the essentials from the underlying physical description of the
%   problem, and to collect and substantiate all physical data pertinent to the
%   problem.}

% \plt{This section presents the solution characteristics by successively refining
%   models.  It starts with the abstract/general Theoretical Models (TMs) and
%   refines them to the concrete/specific Instance Models (IMs).  If necessary
%   there are intermediate refinements to General Definitions (GDs).  All of these
%   refinements can potentially use Assumptions (A) and Data Definitions (DD).
%   TMs are refined to create new models, that are called GMs or IMs. DDs are not
%   refined; they are just used. GDs and IMs are derived, or refined, from other
%   models. DDs are not derived; they are just given. TMs are also just given, but
%   they are refined, not used.  If a potential DD includes a derivation, then
%   that means it is refining other models, which would make it a GD or an IM.}

% \plt{The above makes a distinction between ``refined'' and ``used.'' A model is
%   refined to another model if it is changed by the refinement. When we change a
%   general 3D equation to a 2D equation, we are making a refinement, by applying
%   the assumption that the third dimension does not matter. If we use a
%   definition, like the definition of density, we aren't refining, or changing
%   that definition, we are just using it.}

% \plt{The same information can be a TM in one problem and a DD in another.  It is
%   about how the information is used.  In one problem the definition of
%   acceleration can be a TM, in another it would be a DD.}

% \plt{There is repetition between the information given in the different chunks
%   (TM, GDs etc) with other information in the document.  For instance, the
%   meaning of the symbols, the units etc are repeated.  This is so that the
%   chunks can stand on their own when being read by a reviewer/user.  It also
%   facilitates reuse of the models in a different context.}

% \noindent \plt{The relationships between the parts of the document are show in
%   the following figure.  In this diagram ``may ref'' has the same role as
%   ``uses'' above.  The figure adds ``Likely Changes,'' which are able to
%   reference (use) Assumptions.}

The instance models that govern ANN are presented in
Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the meaning of the
instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

% \plt{The assumptions are a refinement of the scope.  The scope is general, where
%   the assumptions are specific.  All assumptions should be listed, even those
%   that domain experts know so well that they are rarely (if ever) written down.}
% \plt{The document should not take for granted that the reader knows which
%   assumptions have been made. In the case of unusual assumptions, it is
%   recommended that the documentation either include, or point to, an explanation
%   and justification for the assumption.}
% \plt{If it helps with the organization and understandability, the assumptions can be presented as sub sections.  The following sub-sections are options: background theory assumptions, helper theory assumptions, generic theory assumptions, problem specific assumptions, and rationale assumptions}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system.
The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model [TM],
general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or likely
change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

  % \plt{Short description of each assumption.  Each assumption
  %   should have a meaningful label.  Use cross-references to identify the

  %   explicit (or implicit) ``and'' in the text of an assumption.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

% \plt{Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms
%   for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''
%   (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}). Examples of theoretical models are
%   physical laws, constitutive equations, relevant conversion factors, etc.}

% \plt{Optionally the theory section could be divided into subsections to provide more structure 
% and improve understandability and reusability.  Potential subsections include the following: 
% Context theories, background theories, helper theories, generic theories, problem specific 
% theories, final theories and rationale theories.}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that ANN is based

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

% \plt{General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of

%   in abstraction is possible through invoking (using/referencing) Assumptions.
%   For instance, the TM could be Newton's Law of Cooling stated abstracting.  The

In this project, Gradient Descent is a method used to minimize the cost function, essential 
for improving the neural network's accuracy. It adjusts the weights (W) and biases (b) of 
the network by subtracting a fraction (represented by the learning rate $\alpha$) of the cost 
function's gradient ($\nabla$Cost) from the current values.

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of simplified rate of change of temperature}

% \plt{This may be necessary when the necessary information does not fit in the
%   description field.}
% \plt{Derivations are important for justifying a given GD.  You want it to be
%   clear where the equation came from.}

For updating the weights matrices and bias vectors using Gradient Descent, the chain rule is applied:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Last Layer Derivations:} 

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Weight:
    $\frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}} = 
    \frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_j^{(L)}} \times 
    \frac{\partial a_j^{(L)}}{\partial z_j^{(L)}} \times 
    \frac{\partial z_j^{(L)}}{\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}} = 
    2(a_j^{(L)} - y_j) \times \sigma'(z_j^{(L)}) \times a_k^{(L-1)}$

    \item Bias:
    $\frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial b_j^{(L)}} = 
    \frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_j^{(L)}} \times 
    \frac{\partial a_j^{(L)}}{\partial z_j^{(L)}} \times 
    \frac{\partial z_j^{(L)}}{\partial b_j^{(L)}} = 
    2(a_j^{(L)} - y_j) \times \sigma'(z_j^{(L)}) \times 1$

    \item Activation:
    $\frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_k^{(L-1)}} = 
    \sum_{j=0}^{n_{L-1}} \left( 
    \frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_j^{(L)}} \times 
    \frac{\partial a_j^{(L)}}{\partial z_j^{(L)}} \times 
    \frac{\partial z_j^{(L)}}{\partial a_k^{(L-1)}} 
    \right)$
    
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Other Layers Derivations:} 

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Weight:
    $\frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial w_{km}^{(L-1)}} = 
    \frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_k^{(L-1)}} \times 
    \sigma'(z_k^{(L-1)}) \times 
    a_m^{(L-2)}$
    
    \item Bias:
    $\frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial b_k^{(L-1)}} = 
    \frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_k^{(L-1)}} \times 
    \sigma'(z_k^{(L-1)}) \times 
    1$
    
    \item Activation:
    $\frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_m^{(L-2)}} = 
    \sum_{k=0}^{n_{L-2}} \left( 
    \frac{\partial \text{Cost}}{\partial a_k^{(L-1)}} \times 
    \sigma'(z_k^{(L-1)} \times w_{km}^{(L-1)}) 
    \right)$
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

$j$: This index represents a specific neuron in the current layer. 
It's used to refer to each individual output neuron in the last layer of the network.

$k$: This index is used to refer to neurons in the layer preceding 
(L-1) the current one. It's involved in calculations that connect the neurons of two consecutive layers.

$m$: The index $m$ is used to refer to neurons or inputs from an earlier layer than $k$, 
indicating the propagation of influence from one layer to another in the neural network.

These derivations represent how the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect 
to the weights, biases, and activations are computed using the chain rule. For the last layer, 
these derivations are direct and involve the actual outputs of the network compared to the 
target values, which directly contribute to the cost. In other layers, the derivatives are 
computed as a sum over all neurons in the subsequent layer because each neuron's activation in 
layer L-1 contributes to the activations in layer L, thus indirectly affecting the cost. This 
approach ensures that the adjustments made to weights and biases through gradient descent are 
based on how much they contribute to the overall error in the network's predictions.


\subsubsection{Data Definitions}\label{sec_datadef}

% \plt{The Data Definitions are definitions of symbols and equations that are
%   given for the problem.  They are not derived; they are simply used by other
%   models.  For instance, if a problem depends on density, there may be a data
%   definition for the equation defining density.  The DDs are given information
%   that you can use in your other modules.}

% \plt{All Data Definitions should be used (referenced) by at least one other
%   model.}

This section collects and defines all the data needed to build the instance
models. The dimension of each quantity is also given.  
% \plt{Modify the examples
%   below for your problem, and add additional definitions as appropriate.}
In our model, we process RGB images, which are represented as three-dimensional 
(3D) matrices. However, each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue) in an RGB 
image is individually represented by a two-dimensional (2D) matrix. Therefore, 
an RGB image comprises three 2D matrices, one for each color channel, collectively 
forming a 3D matrix structure.

of the images. This

  The feedforward process in neural networks involves input data propagation to

  vectors. These initial settings are crucial as they impact the network's 
  learning and evolution during training. After each iteration the result of this
  part will be used to update the weights and biases.

  $a^{(L)}$: Output activations of the L-th layer in a neural network.

  $a^{(L+1)}$: Activations for the next layer, (L+1), resulting from the current layer's output.

  $\sigma$ (sigma): The activation function applied to layer outputs, influencing neuron firing.

  $b^{(L+1)}$: Bias vector for the (L+1)-th layer, adjusting neuron activation thresholds.

  $W^{(L+1)}$: Weight matrix connecting layer L to layer (L+1), essential for learning patterns.

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

\section{Requirements}

% \plt{The requirements refine the goal statement.  They will make heavy use of
%   references to the instance models.}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] 
The system requires user-uploaded images in a specified format and resolution. 
    % \plt{Requirements
    % for the inputs that are supplied by the user.  This information has to be

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputInputs}:] 
Verify the given inputs are in correct form and satify the required physical constraints
given in the Table~\ref{TblInputVar}. 
The system provides feedback by displaying the classification results for user confirmation.
  % \plt{It isn't
  %   always required, but often echoing the inputs as part of the output is a
  %   good idea.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] 
Classify the uploaded image from \iref{Feedforward}.
% \plt{Calculation
%     related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_VerifyOutput}:] 
The system will provide its classification results based on the trained model, 
acknowledging that accuracy may not be 100\%. 
To validate outputs, the system will incorporate a user feedback mechanism
  % \plt{Verification related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] 
The system presents classification results in an understandable format, clearly indicating the 
identified image categories.
  % \plt{Output related
  %   requirements.}
\end{itemize}

% \plt{Every IM should map to at least one requirement, but not every requirement
%   has to map to a corresponding IM.}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

% \plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
%   criterion to make them verifiable.}
% \plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
%   and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
% to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
% be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
% \plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
%   instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
%   for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
%   describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
%   possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
% \plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
%   SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
%   Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
%   correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
%   solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} 
  The system aims for higher classification accuracy than previous model, 
  measurable through defined quantitative methods, such as cost function (\hyperref[TM:COE]{TM:COE}). 
  % \plt{Characterize the accuracy by giving the context/use for
  %   the software.  Maybe something like, ``The accuracy of the computed
  %   solutions should meet the level needed for $<$engineering or scientific
  %   application$>$.  The level of accuracy achieved by \progname{} shall be
  %   described following the procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and
  %   Validation Plan.''  A link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability} 
The system should be user-friendly and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
  % \plt{Characterize the usability by giving the context/use for the software.
  %   You should likely reference the user characteristics section.  The level of
  %   usability achieved by the software shall be described following the
  %   procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and Validation Plan.  A
  %   link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} 
  The software should be easy to modify.
  % \plt{The effort required to make any of the likely
  %   changes listed for \progname{} should be less than FRACTION of the original
  %   development time.  FRACTION is then a symbolic constant that can be defined
  %   at the end of the report.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} The system is compatible with multiple operating environment.
  % \plt{This NFR is easier to write than the others.  The
  %   systems that \progname{} should run on should be listed here.  When possible
  %   the specific versions of the potential operating environments should be
  %   given.  To make the NFR verifiable a statement could be made that the tests
  %   from a given section of the VnV plan can be successfully run on all of the
  %   possible operating environments.}

% \item Other NFRs that might be discussed include verifiability,
%   understandability and reusability.

\subsection{Rationale}

In this Section, we delve into the reasoning behind key decisions in our documentation. 
The scope was specifically chosen to focus on the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR10}, targeting a manageable 
yet diverse range of image classifications to demonstrate the neural network's capabilities 
effectively. Our modeling choices, including the neural network architecture and algorithms 
like gradient descent, were selected for their proven effectiveness and relevance to the 
image classification task at hand. Assumptions were made based on realistic scenarios and 
limitations, ensuring that our model remains practical and applicable. The typical 
values chosen, such as image dimensions and parameter settings, were guided by 
standard practices in the field and the specifics of the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR10}, aiming to 
optimize the model's performance and accuracy. Each decision was made with careful 
consideration of its impact on the project's objectives and feasibility.

% \plt{Provide a rationale for the decisions made in the documentation.  Rationale
% should be provided for scope decisions, modelling decisions, assumptions and
% typical values.}

\section{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_object}:] 
\aref{object} The system might be changed to evolve to identify multiple objects within a 
single image, enhancing its complexity and usability.

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_class}:] 
\aref{class} The system can be trained on larger dataset, such as CIFAR-100 \cite{CIFAR10}, 
to be able to classify more objects.

% \plt{Give
%     the likely changes, with a reference to the related assumption (aref), as appropriate.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_size}:] 
\aref{size} The model architecture depends on the size of the training dataset. 
Consequently, the size of uploaded images should be always compatible with the size 
of training dataset.
% \plt{Give
%     the unlikely changes.  The design can assume that the changes listed will
%     not occur.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

% \plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

% \plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
%   means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
%   does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

% \plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
%   your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. 
% Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
% general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
% assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
% instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\section{Development Plan}

% \plt{This section is optional.  It is used to explain the plan for developing
%   the software.  In particular, this section gives a list of the order in which
%   the requirements will be implemented.  In the context of a course  this is
%   where you can indicate which requirements will be implemented as part of the
%   course, and which will be ``faked'' as future work.  This section can be
%   organized as a prioritized list of requirements, or it could should the
%   requirements that will be implemented for ``phase 1'', ``phase 2'', etc.}
In this section, we outline our approach to building the software. 
The plan is divided into phases, prioritizing core functionalities first.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Phase1:} Initial development focuses on basic functionalities like image 
  uploading and primary classification training using the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR10}. 
  This phase ensures the system's ability to categorize images correctly.

  \item \textbf{Phase2:} The aim is to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency. 
  However, the extent of improvement will be explored during the development process, 
  as we experiment with algorithm optimizations and neural network architectures.

  \item \textbf{For Coursework:} The primary goal within the course is to establish the 
  foundational image classification functionality (Phase 1), while efforts to enhance 
  accuracy (Phase 2) will be attempted but are subject to the scope and limitations 
  of the coursework.
\end{itemize}

\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}

% \plt{Show the values of the symbolic parameters introduced in the report.}

% \plt{The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
% Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.}

% \plt{The value of FRACTION, for the Maintainability NFR would be given here.}

The following are the values for the symbolic parameters used throughout this report:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Image Dimensions (mxn):} 32x32 (Standard dimensions of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset \cite{CIFAR10}.)

  \item \textbf{Maintainability Fraction (FRACTION):} 0.25 (Indicating that any change should require no more than 
  25\% of the original development effort.)

\end{itemize}
These values are set here for ease of maintenance and to ensure consistency across the report.
